        <h1>Hannah Orr</h1>
        <h2>Graphic Designer</h2>

        <p>I am proficient in Adobe Illustrator and Adobe Photoshop. I am a quick learner and I know a little about Adobe InDesign and VS Code. I am currently a freelance artist and take commissions in my free time. Usually I design characters for people or logos and other promotional material for their projects. My goal is to make sure my customers walk away with not just something they will enjoy, but something that they will cherish forever. </p>
        <p>I love designing T-shirts and logos the best. But I am always up for anything challenging.</p>
